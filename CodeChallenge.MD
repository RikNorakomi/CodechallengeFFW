# Android App Coding Task

## Overview
Create a Star Wars Themed Android app that fetches data from a webservice (e.g., https://swapi.dev/) and displays it using Jetpack Compose. 
The app should be written in Kotlin and should showcase your rapid learning skills in both Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM).

If you need to cut anything from the implementation or make any assumptions due to time constraints, please make a note and let us know later when presenting your solution to us.

## Requirements
- The app should have two screens: a list screen and a detail screen.
- The list screen should display a list of items retrieved from a webservice. Each item should display its title and a thumbnail image.
- Tapping on an item in the list should navigate to the detail screen, which should display the full details of the selected item.
- The app should fetch data from a webservice using KMM and the Kotlinx Serialization library.
- The app should use Jetpack Compose to display the UI.
- The app should handle errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages to the user.
- The app should be well-organized and modular, with clear separation of concerns.
- The app should be fully tested, with unit tests and integration tests for both the Android and KMM modules.

### Bonus Points
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling on the list screen.
- Implement caching of data on the device to improve performance and reduce network usage.
- Use coroutines to manage asynchronous operations.
- Use dependency injection to manage dependencies.
- Add animations and transitions to create a more polished user experience.

## Submission
Please submit your completed code as a GitHub repository. 
The repository should include a README.md file with instructions on how to build and run the app, as well as any other relevant information.
